# PhysicsEngine
This is a simple physics engine made for personal learning purposes, feel free to contribute to the spaghetti mess I made.

## Features:
- Collision Detection
- Toggles for Gravity and Collision
- Attract/Repel to/from the mouuse
## To-Do
- Optimize the crappy O(n^2) algorithms, specifically collision and attraction
- UI to change settings
- Linking Objects
